## ============================================================================
## Specific to tree-sitter and/or @getodk/tree-sitter-xpath
##
## The tree-sitter-xpath build process generates a slew of files, many of
## which we ignore. This section includes two sub-sections:
##
## 1. A set of ignores derived from tree-sitter's own generated .gitignore
##    file, with its patterns adjusted to their place in the
##    tree-sitter-xpath package directory.
##
## 2. A set of additive ignore patterns which are not addressed by those
##    derived patterns, but which we also regard as either build artifacts
##    or detritus left behind in their creation.
##
## Not specified here: a few **other files** are generated by tree-sitter
## which are not appropriate to ignore, because their presence would cause
## conflicts with editor and/or version control. For more detail, see:
##
## ./packages/tree-sitter-xpath/scripts/build/shared.mjs

#  2. Additional ignore patterns beyond those generated by tree-sitter
#
#  Note that some of these may be redundant to those above. Most of these
#  patterns predate tree-sitter's generation of .gitignore. Keeping them intact
#  may make it easier to untangle this nonsense if tree-sitter stops generating
#  such files on every build.
