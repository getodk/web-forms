	 * **PORTING NOTES**
	 *
	 * - In preparing to define this assertion extension, I went to look at the
	 *   {@link https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/#bind-attributes | Bind Attributes}
	 *   spec section. The `constraint` spec language is clearly intended to
	 *   reference the W3C spec's own
	 *   {@link https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xforms-20031014/slice6.html#model-prop-validate | `constraint` specification},
	 *   but it links to the W3C's `relevant` spec (and presumably should be
	 *   updated to use the correct link).
	 *
	 * - Confirmed, in a quick Slack conversation, that it's safe to assume
	 *   `constraint` is only applied to leaf/value nodes. The discussion also
	 *   raised a recent request for group-level `constraint`s, so it's probably
	 *   wise to keep this clarification around in case we want to revisit this in
	 *   the spec.
