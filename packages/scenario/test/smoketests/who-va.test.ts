/**
 * **PORTING NOTES**
 *
 * - Ported tests reference the 2016 version of this form. We should consider
 *   adapting and/or adding tests for later versions of the form, which exercise
 *   additional functionality. For instnace, we also have access to the 2022
 *   version, which also exercises `<setvalue>` actions (and potentially more).
 *
 * - Rather than extending {@link Scenario.next} to accept an `amount`
 *   parameter, we call it for each expected node-set reference. This is more
 *   consistent with most other usage throughout ported tests. An alternative
 *   was considered accepting both an `amount` and an array of expected
 *   references, but that didn't seem to add much (beyond an unnecessary
 *   overload) versus this usage. In cases where there are a large number of
 *   questions covered by JavaRosa's `amount` usage, an array of references is
 *   created, its length compared to ensure it matches JavaRosa's `amount`, and
 *   then the array is iterated to progress through that section of the form.
 *
 * - It seems there may be a mistake in JavaRosa's comments specifying the
 *   expected question label/node-set references: after `Id10022` the comments
 *   suggest the next question will be `Id10021` (which is the **previous**
 *   question). Test failed when asserting that reference, but passes when
 *   asserting `Id10023_a` (which is the next question in the form definition,
 *   both within the model and body). I'm confident enough that this is a
 *   mistake to skip parameterization showing both, and to recommend updating
 *   the comment in JavaRosa. (Both label/reference pairs are included in
 *   comments here.)

		/**
		 * **PORTING NOTES**
		 *
		 * - All of the assertions of expected references at particular points in
		 *   positional state are redundant to the checks performed by our extension
		 *   of {@link Scenario.next}. They've been preserved but commented out.
		 *   This also eliminates the need for these tests to reference
		 *   `TreeReference.genericize` (allowing us to keep those extensions in the
		 *   adjacent `child-vaccination.test.ts` for now).
		 *
		 * - Test fails on assertion of the value at
		 *   `/data/consented/deceased_CRVS/info_on_deceased/ageInDays`. This is
		 *   almost certainly a loss of float precision in the comparison. It's
		 *   unclear whether this should be treated as a bug. My understanding,
		 *   revisiting (albeit skimming for now) the pertinent aspects of the ODK
		 *   XForms and XPath 1.0 specs suggests that it's likely the values should
		 *   be treated as numbers (without additional qualification, per ODK
		 *   XForms), which in turn should be treated as IEEE-754 double-precision
		 *   floats (XPath 1.0). The expression reduces to an expression with format
		 *   YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD. The fractional day numeric values of each,
		 *   when subtracted, produce imprecision in JavaScript's runtime float
		 *   representation (which is IEEE-754 double; that being consistent with
		 *   XPath 1.0 is the reason there isn't currently much effort to address
		 *   precision).
		 *
		 * - Test further fails on writes to some fields—where portions of the test
		 *   loop through large portions of the form state, answering "no" to each
		 *   answer in series—where writes produce an error because those fields
		 *   have a `readonly: true` state. Since we have now implemented an
		 *   explicit 'note' node type, we have now confirmed that in each case, the
		 *   node is considered a 'note': it will always be readonly, and any
		 *   attempted write will fail.
		 *
		 * - The test is parameterized to demonstrate failure without accommodation
		 *   for these issues, and passage when the assertion of `ageInDays` has
		 *   slightly relaxed precision and when there's a guard preventing attempts
		 *   to write values to 'note' nodes.
		 *
		 * - In the last long sequence of iterate-and-answer-"no" steps, several of
		 *   the questions' node-set references only become available (i.e. those
		 *   questions become relevant) as earlier answers in that sequence are
		 *   answered. Those are called out with comments grouping them together, as
		 *   potential candidates for additional assertions of their `relevant`
		 *   state changes. I don't know if we'd get more value by adding those, but
		 *   given the test and its fixture are already so long, I don't think it
		 *   could hurt to add more coverage (e.g. to guard against regressions)
		 *   around additional state changes we've already identified in the course
		 *   of porting the test.
