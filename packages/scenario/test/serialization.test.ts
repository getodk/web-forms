	/**
	 * **PORTING NOTES**
	 *
	 * Discussing these tests in Slack, it was determined that they're not
	 * currently applicable to the web forms project. The first test is ported
	 * largely because it was already most of the way there by this point,
	 * although much of the supporting logic for a more faithful port has been
	 * omitted for now (with some breadcrumbs on thinking behind that supporting
	 * logic left in for posterity in case it becomes applicable in the future).
	 *
	 * We reached the conclusion to defer porting the rest of these tests for now,
	 * on the basis that the current serialization functionality under test is in
	 * support of specific performance optimizations; that the tests exercise
	 * implementation details not directly pertinent to web forms at this time;
	 * that the performance optimizations in question are themselves not likely to
	 * be pertinent to web forms, at least at this time.
	 *
	 * We also agreed that this note would serve as an explanation of the above,
	 * as well as an opportunity to briefly mention that we may have other reasons
	 * to support (de)serialization, and to test that support, likely around
	 * offline functionality. As such, we may want to revisit these skipped
	 * JavaRosa tests if they seem valuable for that effort when we get to it.

		/**

		 * It sounds (from the JavaRosa comment, preserved below) like the
		 * conceptual model here is:
		 *
		 * 0. Given a form with external instance reference, and given an initial
		 *    inability to retrieve the resource for it
		 * 1. JavaRosa will produce a "placeholder" (empty instance representation)
		 *    for the unavailable resource
		 * 2. A client (Collect) may at some point serialize the form state
		 * 3. The client may then attempt to deserialize that serialization, calling
		 *    into JavaRosa to do so
		 * 4. Because(?) JavaRosa used a "placeholder" prior to that serialization,
		 *    upon deserialization it will once again attempt to retrieve the
		 *    external instance resource
		 * 5. While parsing will produce a "placeholder" for an unretrievable
		 *    external instance resource, deserialization will produce an error
		 *    instead.
		 * 6. It is expected that a client will resolve this error condition by
		 *    bypassing deserialization (and potentially discarding the serialized
		 *    state?), by re-parsing the form... thereby allowing JavaRosa to once
		 *    again produce a "placeholder".
		 *
		 * It's unclear if any of this is pertinent to web forms, but it's hard not
		 * to ask... if this mental model is roughly correct:
		 *
		 * - Is this ceremony something essential to the distinction between "parse"
		 *   and "deserialize"? Is there additional mental model to help make the
		 *   distinction more clear?
		 *
		 * - Insofar as we may find ourselves implementing similar logic (albeit
		 *   serving other purposes), how can we establish a clear interface
		 *   contract around behaviors like this? Should it be more consistent? Does
		 *   our current {@link LoadFormOptions.fetchFormDefinition} provide enough
		 *   informational surface area to communicate such intent (and allow both
		 *   clients and engine alike to have clarity of that intent at
		 *   call/handling sites)?
		 *
		 * - - -
		 *
		 * JR:
		 *
		 * Clients would typically catch this exception and try parsing the form
		 * again which would succeed by using the placeholder.

		 *
		 * Expanding on the mental model we're trying to form in the skipped test
		 * directly above...
		 *
		 * - If this produces an error condition, why is it deferred to _accessing a
		 *   select's available itemset choices_?
		 *
		 * - The JavaRosa comment, preserved below, suggests that the error should
		 *   occur "when making a choice". That makes it sound like the intent is:
		 *
		 *     0. Parsing fails to resolve an external instance resource, producing
		 *        a "placeholder" representation.
		 *
		 *     1. Deserialization resolves that resource.
		 *
		 *     2. This is considered an inconsistent state, which cannot be
		 *        reconciled on the deserialized state.
		 *
		 *     3. An allowance is made for operating on form state with this
		 *        inconsistency **so long as the inconsistency isn't consulted in a
		 *        subsequent state change**.
		 *
		 *     If that's the case... why isn't the error produced on a write call,
		 *     rather than when attempting to read the options? Wouldn't this
		 *     produce an error by simply proceeding through the deserialized form
		 *     state without making any state change at all?
		 *
		 * - - -
		 *
		 * JR:
		 *
		 * It would be possible for a formdef to be serialized without access to the
		 * external secondary instance and then deserialized with access. In that
		 * case, there's nothing to validate that the value and label references for
		 * a dynamic select correspond to real nodes in the secondary instance so
		 * there's a runtime exception when making a choice.
