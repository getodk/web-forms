	 * to initialize client-facing state, and will mutate properties of the object
	 * when their corresponding state is changed.
	 *
	 * A client may use this function to provide its own implementation of
	 * reactivity with semantics like those described above. The mechanism of
	 * reactivity, if any, is at the discretion of the client. It is expected that
	 * clients providing this function will use a reactive subscribe-on-read
	 * mechanism to handle state updates conveyed by the engine.
