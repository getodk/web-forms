	//

	//
	//    - Borrow the browser DOM's notion of node "connected"-ness. When a node

	 *
	 *    It **may** also be pre-computed by the engine so that direct reads are
	 *    less computationally expensive, but such optimizations cannot be
	 *    guaranteed by the engine at this time.
	 *
	 * 2. For clients providing an {@link OpaqueReactiveObjectFactory}, accessing
	 *    validation state within a reactive context **will produce updates** to
	 *    the validation state, as long as the client retains a subscription to
	 *    that state.
	 *
	 *    If it is possible to detect interruption of such client- reactive
	 *    subscriptions, the engine _may defer computations_ until subsequent
	 *    client read/re-subscription, in order to reduce unnecessary
	 *    computational overhead. Again, such optimizations cannot be guaranteed
	 *    by the engine at this time.
	 *
	 * @todo it's easier to conceive a reliable, general solution to optimizing
	 * the direct read case, than it is for the client-reactive case (largely
	 * because our solution for client reactivity is intentionally opaque). If it
	 * turns out that such optimizations are crucial for overall usability, the
	 * client-reactive case may best be served by additional APIs for reactive
	 * clients to explicitly pause and resume recomputation.
