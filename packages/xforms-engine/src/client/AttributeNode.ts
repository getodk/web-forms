	// repeat instances. This suggests that perhaps `parent` should also be part
	// of the node's state. However that would be insufficient to communicate the
	// same information about a removed node's descendants. Some considerations:
	//
	// 1. If `parent` becomes part of state, how do we communicate that removal is
	//    the only possible state change (as in, a child node will never be
	//    reassigned to another parent)?
	// 2. If `parent` does become nullable state, how best to convey the same
	//    information for removed descendants. Some ideas:
	//
	//    - Apply null-as-removed recursively.
	//
	//    - Borrow the browser DOM's notion of node "connected"-ness. When a node
	//      is removed, its `isConnected` property is `false`. The same is true
	//      for any of its descendants, even though they retain their own direct
	//      parent reference.
