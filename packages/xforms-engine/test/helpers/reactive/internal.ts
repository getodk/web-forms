/**
 * @module - Provides a reactivity implementation with the minimal functionality
 * needed for satisfying **and testing** the engine's use of
 * {@link OpaqueReactiveObjectFactory}.
 *
 * The implementation is partially based on
 * {@link https://dev.to/ryansolid/building-a-reactive-library-from-scratch-1i0p},
 * a reactive internals tutorial by the creator of Solid. As such, it bears some
 * resemblance to the internal design of Solid's own reactive primitives. But it
 * intentionally differs in a few ways:
 *
 * - It doesn't expose a reactive atomic value primitive (e.g. a "signal"), as
 *   we don't use this in our engine/client interface.
 *
 * - That primitive is used to compose others internally, however. Its internal
 *   shape is slightly different, but it preserves Solid's intentional
 *   read/write segregation design. (Not that it matters from the outside, but
 *   it should help with reasoning about the internal compositions.)
 *
 * - The primitives it does expose have slightly different names. This is mostly
 *   to avoid confusion if/where these APIs might coexist with Solid's APIs in
 *   the same module, and to avoid auto-import mistakes so long as we continue
 *   to use Solid for internal reactivity concerns.
 *
 * @todo it's entirely possible this limited reactive API is (or becomes)
 * actually suitable for engine-internal use cases, and we might consider
 * dropping dependencies for such internal use.

 * and generally try to avoid exposing reactive stuff outside the reactive test
 * scope's callback (e.g. either with outer scope bindings, or the reactive
